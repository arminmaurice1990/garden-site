          <p class="employee-description">
            Founder of Gardening By Design, Mary-Anne’s aesthetic and design process is a product of her remarkable childhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up in the countryside, as one of 12 siblings, she’d always gravitated towards the outdoors. 
            It was a chance to slip away from her house, which was often crowded and busy. 
            She loved the natural beauty of rivers, rocks, and wild grasses—as well as the smell of dirt. 
            This was also the time she felt most inventive allowing her imagination to run free.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her appreciation and understanding of plants began during time spent in northern Quebec planting tree seedlings, and was further satisfied while working with Artistic Landscape Designs Ltd. Gardening and design is a organic and nostalgic practice her for—a chance to reconnect with her roots—and to give space and purpose to plant life.

          <p class="employee-description">
            At the heart of Erin’s design practice is her belief that all spaces should offer both an uplifting feeling and a particular energy. 
            Complex spaces motivate and intrigue her because of her love for strategizing solutions—she is aware of the power of nature and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her appetite for plant-life and botany stem from the many hours she spent in the garden with her mother and grandmother. 
            Her experience with Artistic Landscape Designs Ltd., and background in art education, and
          </p>
          <p>
            communications has provided her with a particularly unique approach to the industry.

          <p class="employee-description">
            A trained artist and visionary, Engelina found her niche and purpose in Gardening By Design. 
            She spent her life navigating the worlds of entrepreneurship and artistry coming from a lineage of 
            business owners on her father’s side and artists on her mother’s side—experience now invaluable to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            A family that spent most of their time in the garden, she further indulged these interests while working with Artistic Landscape Designs Ltd., 
            in their perennial greenhouses. This marked the point at which she became a specialist in horticulture.
            She obtained a degree from Ryerson University in Interior Design and chose to apply her knowledge to exteriors and outdoor spaces. 
            Her enthusiasm lies in designing areas that are always changing, growing, and adapting—never static.
