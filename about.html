          <p class="employee-description">
            Founder of Gardening By Design, Mary-Anne’s aesthetic and design process is a product of her remarkable childhood.

            Growing up in the countryside, as one of 12 siblings, she’d always gravitated towards the outdoors. 
            It was a chance to slip away from her house, which was often crowded and busy. 
            She loved the natural beauty of rivers, rocks, and wild grasses—as well as the smell of dirt. 
            This was also the time she felt most inventive allowing her imagination to run free.

            Her appreciation and understanding of plants began during time spent in northern Quebec planting tree seedlings, and was further satisfied while working with Artistic Landscape Designs Ltd. Gardening and design is a organic and nostalgic practice her for—a chance to reconnect with her roots—and to give space and purpose to plant life.
