        <p class="blog-pagraph">At the heart of Erin’s design practice is her belief that 
          all spaces should offer both an uplifting feeling and a particular energy. 
          Complex spaces motivate and intrigue her because of her love for strategizing solutions—she 
          is aware of the power of nature and design.
  
          Her appetite for plant-life and botany stem from the many hours she spent in the garden with her mother and grandmother. Her experience with Artistic Landscape Designs Ltd., and background in art education, 
          and communications has provided her with a particularly unique approach to the industry. 
          Her goal is to introduce fresh and futuristic ideas to gardens and to achieve the best results through strong client relationships.
